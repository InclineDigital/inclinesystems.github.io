# [Incline](/) knows JavaScript

![JavaScript](/assets/images/javascript.svg)

We've been building JavaScript-driven web apps since we started in 2005.
The JavaScript world was a little bit different back then - *jQuery didn't even exist yet* -
but we've kept up with the changes continue to use the advancing state-of-the-art to bring increased value to our customers.

# [Incline](/) knows Node

![Node.js](/assets/images/nodejs.svg)

We know Node.js inside and out because we helped build it.
We've been involved in the Node community since v0.2,
 made multiple contributions to Node.js core,
 and authored or contributed to hundreds of npm modules.

# [Incline](/) knows Full-Stack

![React](/assets/images/react.svg)

Our current standard stack is ES6 (ES2017) React/Redux on the client and server, using Node.js with Next.js to power the backend.
WebSockets provide realtime updates, and we're currently investigating WASM for increased performance.

That said, we're happy to work with whatever you have in place already, and rarely feel the need for massive re-writes or migrations.
