OLED Saver is a minimal watchface for WearOS (formerly Android Wear) that can be used as a default choice for always-on OLED displays. 
It prevents burn-in by moving the time and notification dot around the screen to a new random location once per minute.
It uses minimal resources in terms of CPU load, RAM, and storage, freeing those up for other tasks (or longer battery life.)

It will be available on the Play Store soon.
